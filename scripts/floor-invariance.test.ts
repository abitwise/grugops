// floor-invariance.test.ts — the SC3 un-dialable-safety-floor sweep (GOV-01/GOV-02, D-12).
//
// The governance dials (context.human_admission, context.audit_retention) only ever TIGHTEN
// admission: each step up ADDS a named-human / durable-record requirement to more entries. There is
// NO dial value — lean, paranoid, or outright garbage — that SUBTRACTS a safety floor. This test is
// the structural proof scaffold: it sweeps EVERY dial value (including bogus/garbage strings) and
// asserts all FOUR un-dialable floor invariants still REFUSE, plus the structural dials-only-tighten
// guarantee.
//
// THE FOUR FLOOR INVARIANTS (un-dialable at every governance value):
//   1. refuse-self     — a self-stamped finding (verified_by === by) is a structural FAIL.
//   2. no-fabrication  — admit() never silently rewrites a note to make it pass; a hollow-evidence
//                        stamp still refuses and the note text is unchanged on refusal.
//   3. test-integrity  — quality.test_integrity has NO `off` value in any mode (TINT-03); the
//                        allowed set is {warn, block}. The governance dials cannot add `off`.
//   4. guard byte-frozen — the prod-deploy guard hooks/guard.ts is byte-unchanged (D-02); humans
//                        hold merge/deploy via the unchanged guard.
//
// THE STRUCTURAL GUARANTEE (the heart of SC3): a garbage / unknown human_admission value is treated
// conservatively (never as `off`-equivalent that opens a hole). The dials ADD a refusal branch; no
// value REMOVES an existing floor refusal. Concretely: a garbage human_admission must NEVER admit a
// high-severity finding lacking a human:NAME stamp.
//
// COMPOSITION: this test composes the two existing analogs rather than reimplementing a parser/guard —
//   - the config-load + repo-root resolution shape from config-queue-consistency.test.ts:23-30, and
//   - the spawn-the-COMMITTED-.js discipline from hooks/guard.test.ts (target the artifact, never .ts).
// It imports the COMMITTED scripts/context-io.js for the pure-function floor checks (validate/admit).
//
// D-12 / [[grugops-safety-invariant-green-suite-insufficient]]: a GREEN sweep is NECESSARY BUT NOT
// SUFFICIENT for a safety floor. This file is the author's proof scaffold; the phase plan's blocking
// checkpoint (Task 25-03-04) requires an INDEPENDENT opus-grade red-team to reproduce the floor
// adversarially against the committed .js before the SC3 floor is considered proven. This test does
// NOT, by itself, declare the floor proven.
//
// Vitest globals:false (the repo default) → import test fns explicitly.
