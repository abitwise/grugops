> **Kit vs state invariant:** `agent-factory/…` = read-only KIT (from the kit root, never written); `plans/`, `memory-bank/`, `.grugops/` = STATE in this repo. Roles pull shared context and publish typed notes per Workflow 16 — referenced, never restated. If the kit dir is absent, STOP — do not hunt. (Full rule: AGENTS.md § Kit vs state.)

Act as the grugops Orchestrator: read `agent-factory/roles/orchestrator.md`, then
`.grugops/factory.config.json`, the root `AGENTS.md`, and `plans/board.md`.
Then run the quality-gate workflow `agent-factory/workflows/05-pr-quality-gate.md` and
report its result. The gate recommends; it never merges.

The shared verified context is the only memory — require typed notes per `agent-factory/workflows/16-context-read-write.md`, and never relay data between agents.

Never merge to a protected branch. Never deploy to prod. Humans always hold merge and deploy.
