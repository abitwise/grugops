## Overview

grugops is built bottom-up as a file protocol, not a runtime. v1.0 froze the shared vocabulary, built the 16 roles + 14 workflows + contracts + adapters + both Claude forms + installers + validator + brand collateral, and proved the chain with a dogfood. v1.1 redesigned the install to a shared-location two-root model (read-only kit at `${GRUGOPS_HOME:-$HOME/.grugops}`, per-repo state in the target) with a path rewrite, a two-root installer, a `--check` doctor, and a false-green-proof validator. v1.2 deepened the kit itself: it opened with an SDLC-coverage audit plus the mechanical foundation guards (WR-05 spawn grep, single-source adapter-size check, AGENTS.md byte budget, voice-lint, config-dial contract) so every later content phase wrote into a guarded environment; then a senior-persona overhaul laid the substrate, BDD+TDD closed the business→engineer handoff, a frontend/UI persona and an ASVS security audit ran as parallel content streams, then a TypeScript tooling migration converted the script layer (installers, validator, generator, guards) to a zero-build cross-platform foundation, the §14 quality gate converged all of it (lint + UI/E2E + test-integrity) on that TS foundation, install migrate/update landed as an independent track, a generated docs catalog documented the finished 17-role / 16-workflow set, and finally Phase 19 reopened the milestone post-Phase-18 to add an honest Tier-1/Tier-2 auto-UAT harness.

**v2.0 was a major architecture pivot, and it landed.** It replaced the centralized Orchestrator + static handoff packets with three DeLM-derived primitives (arXiv 2606.10662) — a **shared verified context** (typed notes, read-before-act / write-after-verify), a **file-based task queue** (agents claim work atomically without a central router), and **parallel agents** (Claude Code primary via the `Agent` tool; the other four CLIs degrade to sequential over the same files, converging on identical on-disk artifacts as proven by a dual-path equivalence oracle). The whole decentralization shipped with **zero new runtime dependencies** — `node:fs` + markdown + the Claude Code `Agent` tool on top of the v1.2 committed-`.js` tooling layer. grugops's differentiator held and is now mechanical: **"verified" means passed the §14 behavior gate**, recorded as an auditable, human-gatable `verified_by` stamp the writing agent cannot forge or self-set — never a black-box blackboard. Built foundation-first (20–22 mechanized the substrate, verifier, and compaction before any role used them), then parallel execution + grep-to-zero handoff removal (23–24), governance (25), and the equivalence-oracle dogfood last (26).

**Two honest outcomes worth keeping visible.** First, grugops's *own* success/cost gain remains **`UNKNOWN - verify`** — Phase 26 built the measurement and it reports no number rather than borrowing DeLM's. Second, the A3/DOG-02 waiver was **not** retired: Phase 26 built the evidence gate that would retire it, and the gate correctly refused to fire because one captured live run was missing (GAP-D1). Both are the no-fabrication constraint working as designed.

**The expensive lesson of v2.0:** across three safety invariants (CMP-02, WR-05, GOV-01) there were **13 documented cases where a fully green test suite still admitted a bypass** — each time because a heuristic detector was a strict subset of the real format's grammar, making the format the attack surface. Closure came only from structural fixes (one authority per predicate; delete the second grammar; move the gate to the point of effect) plus independent red-teaming plus self-reproduction. Budget for this on any future guard/oracle work.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**

- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Phase numbering is continuous across milestones — it never resets. v2.0 ran Phases 20–26; the next milestone continues from Phase 27.

### 📋 Next milestone — not yet defined

Run `/gsd-new-milestone` to start the next cycle (questioning → research → requirements → roadmap). Phase numbering continues from 26.

**Standing obligations carried in** (detail in `.planning/PROJECT.md` → Requirements → Active):

1. **GAP-D1** — capture ONE live dual-path run on an authed box → flip A3/DOG-02 + the coupled `examples/03-ticket-to-pr.md` edit. Oldest open item in the project (since v1.0).
2. **Windows-portability pass** — `windows-latest` leg red on 3 test files; 7 of 9 failures are harness/fixture artifacts, 2 are a ubuntu-scoped dev gate, **zero in the v2.0 substrate**. Then flip the Phase-20 human item on green.
3. **`orchestrator.md` size** — 7562B against a 7165B WARN threshold, growing every phase. Trim or split before adding to it.
4. **Fail-safe residuals** — all fail-closed, none silent.
5. **Hygiene** — delete `agent-factory/handoffs/.gitkeep`; reconcile `CLAUDE.md` (still describes handoff packets + a routing Orchestrator).

**Totals:** 26 phases · **4 milestones shipped** (v1.0 + v1.1 + v1.2 + v2.0). No active milestone — run `/gsd-new-milestone` to define the next one.

**v2.0 final:** all 7 phases (20–26) complete and archived 2026-07-28. Audit `tech_debt` — 28/28 requirements satisfied, 7/7 phases verified, 8/8 integration boundaries wired, 7/7 Nyquist compliant, no blockers. Closed as `override_closeout` (Phase 20's Windows-CI human item genuinely open; Phase 25's `unknown` is a frontmatter-parse artifact, not a gap). 11 open artifacts deferred, 9 of them pre-v2.0 carryover.
